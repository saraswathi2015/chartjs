Chart.js with React
About the Project
This project integrates Chart.js with React to create interactive and dynamic data visualizations. Chart.js is a popular JavaScript library used to create beautiful charts such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and more. In this project, we demonstrate how to use React to render charts dynamically based on data input.

Features
✅ Integration of Chart.js with React components
✅ Interactive charts (Bar, Line, Pie)
✅ Customizable chart options (colors, legends, tooltips)
✅ Dynamic rendering based on data
✅ Mobile-friendly and responsive design
✅ Easy to extend with additional chart types and data sources

Technologies Used
React.js - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Chart.js - Library for creating interactive charts
npm - Package manager for managing dependencies
CSS - For styling the charts and layout
